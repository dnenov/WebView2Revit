# WebView2Revit
 WebView2 inside Revit

This app works against Autodesk Revit 2021. To install a free trial of Revit, download from [here](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/revit/free-trial) (it will require registration and so on).

You might have to istall the [Evergreen Standalone Installer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) for WebView2 to work correctly.
